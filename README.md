Minecraft Multi-Server Pinger Discord Embed

What does this bot do?
It sends an embed and uses mcsrvstat API and checks if the list of your servers are online or not
Once it sends the embed, it will store the message ID, and edits the embed once refreshes.

You can store an array of servers and asks it whether to get player number or not,
Good for monitoring Minecraft networks.

How to host yourself?
Edit the config.json file and enter your details
Edit the main.py file and enter your servers and embed config

run main.py, and you're done!
